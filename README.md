Simple OOP, showcasing inheritance using a baseclass, subclass, abstract methods, and an interface.
Creating instances of different objects with both base properties with set values and unique ones.
Easy use of their respective methods, both new and base ones implemented using the abstract method.
Tried to keep it as universal as possible for scaling-purposes.

Classes are categorized for easier readability.
